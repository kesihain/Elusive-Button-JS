# Elusive-Button-JS
This is a simple clicker app where the button avoids you. If you're patient though, you might like where the button takes you

#### Features
1. Button moves away each time user hovers over it.
2. Button gets tired after 10 hovers and gives up.
3. User can either play the patient game and hover 10 times or try to click on the button mid-movement.(I've tried it. this can be done if you have fps fingers)

#### How to run ?
1. download zip file or clone repo
2. Open index.html with browser (eg. Google Chrome)
